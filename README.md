## Description

Avery's Organics is a mid-sized farm in Northern Oregon that grows organic produce and sells it at farmers markets throughout town. Since Avery's is at a different market almost every day, they've started a website to show customers which market they will be at on a given day.

Avery's also grows different crops in different seasons. They'd like to display what produce is available during which months on their site too.
